        <p> Another strand of design pedagogy that has been somewhat influential in computing pedagogy is constructionism. Although not explicit about race, class, gender, or disability politics, this is a pedagogical approach that centers context, situated <a href="https://gender-race-empire.tumblr.com/">knowledge</a><!-- add link-->, and learning by doing. Constructionist learning theory and pedagogy was developed by Seymour Papert, a mathematician, computer scientist, and educator who contributed to the development of <a href="https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:30985/">artificial intelligence </a><!-- add link
        -->and was one of the creators of the Logo programming language for children. Papert built atop child development psychologist Jean Piaget’s work. Piaget rejected the idea that learning takes place when an educator transmits a piece of information to the learner’s brain—in Freirian terms, the banking method of education. Instead, for Piaget, learning is experiential: it takes place through an active process where the learner develops the ability to modify or transform an object or idea. Papert took Piaget’s theories and synthesized them into constructionism’s two central concepts: first, that learning is a <a href="https://selfieresearchers.com/the-selfie-course/">reconstruction</a><!-- add reconstruction link
        -->, rather than a transmission, of knowledge; second, that “learning is most effective when part of an activity the learner experiences as constructing a <a href="http://amillionbluepages.net/contribute.shtml">meaningful product</a>.” Based on these ideas, Papert helped create Logo, LEGO Mindstorms, and the (problematic) One Laptop per Child (OLPC) project.

Assignment: Pick a paragraph from this chapter of Costanza-Chock and reproduce it as a web page. Link various words on the paragraph to pages from the digital pedagogy site (make at least four different connections). Also create a second page that acts as a reflection or artist’s statement explaining why you made the connections you did. This page should have a photograph representative of you (not necessarily a photo of you). Use a separate .css file to control the style on both pages (change at least two elements). After you upload these to github, create a preview link (see my Twine example on github) and post that link in the readme.md file.
