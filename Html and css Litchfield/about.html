        <h2>Hi! Claire wrote this site, with help from a paragraph from Costanza-Chock.</h2>
    
        <p>Claire's first attempt at what feels like real code has gone surprisingly well so far. Her normal literary world, however, is not as far removed from this form of digital humanities as she previously thought.  <br>  <br> <i>(omniscient narration is awkward to write but also very code-esc: explicitly telling one thing, with potentionally having an effect on a dozen others)</i> 
          <br>
             <br>
            Please read with the knowledge that I am fairly biased towards book related things: I like to hold things in my hands. However, I see a lot of worth and strength in the linked digital projects. Also - please forgive typos, we are all human... I hope 
              <br>
